Finally, my website works. So I want to begin to write down something about my
research and life everyday.

In this week, I aims to submit my first journal paper out. Since I plan to go
travel in the end of next week. I'd better finish all the work in next week.

To dispose the week, I plan to finish the draft before Sunday.

That's all. I will begin to edit my paper.

Enjoy!
