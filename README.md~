#### Method 1: new master's repository (The Best)

1. First [fork](https://github.com/grrinchas/aliquam/fork) it.
2. Change your forked repository name _aliquam_ to __userName.github.io__ where
   __userName__ is your github user name.
3. Access your new blog via [https://username.github.io](https://username.github.io).
4. [See configuration](#configuration).

#### Method 2: gh-pages in existing repository
1. Create a new branch called _gh-pages_ in the repository where you want to add a template [managing branches](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/).
2. From command line run `git clone https://github.com/grrinchas/aliquam` - this will clone _aliquam_ template to your computer.
3. Create new branch `git checkout -b gh-pages` where _gh-pages_ will be your branch name.
4. Add remote, which is your repo from the first step, to your new branch `git remote add gh-pages https://github.com/<yourName>/<yourMaster>/gh-pages`. _yourName_ is your account name and _yourMaster_ is your repository.
5. Push new branch to remote `git push gh-pages`.
6. Update `_config.yml` file by changing `baseurl: "<branchName>"` _branchName_ is your branch name where _gh-pages_ resides. See [configuration](#configuration).
